        "At Capital One, you'll almost always be working with a diverse team, including business analysts, engineers, product managers, and senior leaders. This solution provides a thorough analysis of credit card transaction data with a focus on fraud detection. The analysis is structured to be clear, well-documented, and easy to understand for technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",
