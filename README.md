## 🛠️ Setup and Requirements

### 🔹 Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To avoid conflicts with other dependencies, it's highly recommended to create a new virtual environment before installing the required packages.

#### **Using Conda (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create and activate a new environment
conda create -n fraud_detection python=3.10 -y
conda activate fraud_detection
```

#### **Using venv**
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv fraud_env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
fraud_env\\Scripts\\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source fraud_env/bin/activate
```

---

### 📦 Install Required Packages
After setting up the environment, install the necessary dependencies.

#### **Install from `requirements.txt` (Preferred)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### **Manually Install Core Dependencies**
Alternatively, you can install the required packages individually:
```bash
# Core libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tqdm ipykernel jupyter

# Handling class imbalance
pip install imbalanced-learn

# XGBoost for advanced modeling
pip install xgboost
```

## 📂 File Organization
Ensure all provided files are placed in the same directory for seamless execution.

| File Name           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `data_loader.py`    | Loads and describes the dataset |
| `visualization.py`  | Generates visualizations and insights |
| `data_wrangling.py` | Handles duplicates and recurring transactions |
| `modeling.py`       | Builds, trains, and evaluates machine learning models |

---

## Next Steps
1. Load and explore your dataset using `data_loader.py`.
2. Visualize the data with `visualization.py` to gain insights.
3. Preprocess and clean your dataset using `data_wrangling.py`.
4. Train and evaluate models with `modeling.py`.
